  <p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
    <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
    <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
    <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
    <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as
      you need them to.</li>
    <li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li>
  </ul>
