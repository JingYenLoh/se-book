<div id="body">

**It is not necessary to be 100% defensive all the time.** While defensive code may be less prone to be misused or abused, such code can also be more complicated and slower to run.

The suitable degree of defensiveness depends on many factors such as:

* How critical is the system?
* Will the code be used by programmers other than the author?
* The level of programming language support for defensive programming
* The overhead of being defensive
