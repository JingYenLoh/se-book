**Classes form the basis of class diagrams. _Associations_ among objects/classes play an important role in an OO solution.**

The most basic class diagram is a bunch of classes with some solid lines among them to represent associations, such as this one.

In addition, **associations can show additional decorations such as _association labels_, _association roles_, _multiplicity_ and _navigability_** to add more information to a class diagram.
