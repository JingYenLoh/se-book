**A _model_ is anything used in any way to represent anything else.** 

<tip-box> 

:package: A class diagram is a model that represents an OOP software design and is drawn using the UML modeling notation.

</tip-box>

**A _model_ provides a simpler view of a complex entity because a model captures only a selected aspect.** This omission of some aspects implies models are abstractions.

<tip-box> 

:package: A class diagram captures the class structure of the software design but not the runtime behavior.

</tip-box>

**Multiple models of the same entity may be needed to capture it fully.** 

<tip-box>
