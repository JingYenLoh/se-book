Given below is an extract from the {{ oracle }}, with slight adaptations.

<blockquote>

* An _abstract class_ is a class that is declared `abstract`â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
* An _abstract method_ is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:<br>
  `abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);`

If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract, as in:

```java
public abstract class GraphicObject {
   // declare fields
   // declare nonabstract methods
   abstract void draw();
}
```

When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.

In an object-oriented drawing application, you can draw circles, rectangles, lines, Bezier curves, and many other graphic objects. These objects all have certain states (for example: position, orientation, line color, fill color) and behaviors (for example: moveTo, rotate, resize, draw) in common. Some of these states and behaviors are the same for all graphic objects (for example: position, fill color, and moveTo). Others require different implementations (for example, resize or draw). All `GraphicObjects` must be able to draw or resize themselves; they just differ in how they do it. This is a perfect situation for an abstract superclass. You can take advantage of the similarities and declare all the graphic objects to inherit from the same abstract parent object (for example, `GraphicObject`). Classes `Rectangle`, `Line`, `Bezier`, and `Circle` inherit from `GraphicObject`.

First, you declare an abstract class, `GraphicObject`, to provide member variables and methods that are wholly shared by all subclasses, such as the current position and the `moveTo` method. `GraphicObject` also declares abstract methods for methods, such as draw or resize, that need to be implemented by all subclasses but must be implemented in different ways. The `GraphicObject` class can look something like this:

```java
abstract class GraphicObject {
    int x, y;
    ...
    void moveTo(int newX, int newY) {
        ...
    }
    abstract void draw();
    abstract void resize();
}
```

Each non-abstract subclass of `GraphicObject`, such as `Circle` and `Rectangle`, must provide implementations for the draw and resize methods:

```java
class Circle extends GraphicObject {
    void draw() {
        ...
    }
    void resize() {
        ...
    }
}

class Rectangle extends GraphicObject {
    void draw() {
        ...
    }
    void resize() {
        ...
    }
}
```
