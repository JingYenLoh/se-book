**An abstract method is simply the method interface without the implementation.** 

<tip-box>

{{ icon_example }} The `Account` class has an abstract method (`addInterest()`).

</tip-box>

**A class that has an abstract method becomes an abstract class**. Evan a class that does not have any abstract method can be declared as an abstract class. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
