**A _positive test case_ is when the test is designed to produce an expected/valid behavior. A negative test case is designed to produce a behavior that indicates an invalid/unexpected situation, such as an error message.**

<tip-box>

:package: Consider testing of the method `print(Integer i)` which prints the value of `i`.

* A positive test case: `i == new Integer(50)`
* A negative test case: `i == null;`
