#### Composition

</div>

<div id="body">

**A composition is an association that represents a strong _whole-part_ relationship.** When the _whole_ is destroyed, _parts_ are destroyed too.

<tip-box>

{{ icon_example }} A `Board` (used for playing board games) consists of `Square` objects.

</tip-box>

**Composition also implies that there cannot be cyclical links**. 

<tip-box>

{{ icon_example }} The ‘sub-folder’ association between `Folder` objects is a composition type association. That means if the `Folder` object `foo` is a sub folder of `Folder` object `bar`, `bar` cannot be a sub-folder of `foo`.
