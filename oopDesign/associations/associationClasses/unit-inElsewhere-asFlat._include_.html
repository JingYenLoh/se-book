      <p><strong>An <em>association class</em> represents additional information about an association.</strong> It is a normal class but plays a special role from a design point of view.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> A <code>Man</code> class and a <code>Woman</code> class is linked with a ‘married to’ association and there is a need to store the date of marriage. However, that data is related
          to the association rather than specifically owned by either the <code>Man</code> object or the <code>Woman</code> object. In such situations, an additional association class can be introduced, e.g. a <code>Marriage</code> class, to store such
          information.</p>
