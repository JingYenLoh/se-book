#### Big-Bang vs Incremental Integration :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

**_Big-bang integration_: integrate all components at the same time.** 

<tip-box type="wrong"> 

Big-bang is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than when problems are uncovered incrementally.

</tip-box>

**_Incremental integration_: integrate few components at a time.** This approach is better than the big-bang integration because it surfaces integration problems in a more manageable way.
