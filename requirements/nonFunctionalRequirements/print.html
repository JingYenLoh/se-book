  <p>There are two kinds of requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Functional requirements</em> specify what the system should do.</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Non-functional requirements</em> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <tip-box>
    <p>ðŸ“¦ Some examples of non-functional requirement categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data requirements e.g. size,
        <tooltip content="how often do data change">volatility</tooltip>,
        <tooltip content="saving data permanenetly">persistency</tooltip> etc.,</li>
      <li>Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which system would operate or need to be compatible with.</li>
      <li>Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability,
        Security, Stability, Testability, and more ...</li>
    </ul>
    <panel type="seamless" header=":package: Some concrete examples of NFRs" expanded="">
      <ul>
        <li>Business/domain rules: e.g. the size of the minefield cannot be smaller than five.</li>
        <li>Constraints: e.g. the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
        <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
        <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
        <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
        <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
        <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
        <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </panel>

  <p>We should spend extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because <strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed">Â e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span> and sometimes <strong>they are critical to the success of the software.</strong>    <span class="dimmed">Â E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionality.</span></p>
