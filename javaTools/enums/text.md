>An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. Common examples include compass directions (values of `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, and `WEST`) and the days of the week.
>
>Because they are constants, the names of an enum type's fields are in uppercase letters.
>In the Java programming language, you define an enum type by using the `enum` keyword. For example, you would specify a days-of-the-week enum type as:
>```java
>public enum Day {
>    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
>    THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
>}
>```
>
>You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants. That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and data sets where you know all possible values at compile timeâ€”for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, and so on.

Note that while enumerations are usually a simple set of fixed values, Java enumerations can have behaviors too. To learn how to implement enumerations, read [this tutorial (from Oracle)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html)
