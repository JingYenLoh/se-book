  <p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>    because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where
    more faults are found.</p>

    <p>📦 Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even
        if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>💡 <strong>Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>.</strong></p>
