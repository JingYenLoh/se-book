  <p><strong>Delaying testing until the full product is complete has a number of disadvantages:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple
      inter-related bugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
    <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
    <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Therefore, it is better to do early testing</strong>, as hinted by the popular rule of thumb given below, also illustrated by the graph below it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The earlier a bug is found, the easier and cheaper to have it fixed.</p>

  <p>Such early testing of partially developed software is usually, and by necessity, done by the developers themselves i.e. developer testing.</p>
