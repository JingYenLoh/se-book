<span id="title">Fork: Creating a remote copy</span>

<div id="body">

**_Forking_ creates a remote copy of a GitHub repo**. As you know, cloning creates a local copy of a repo. In contrast, Forking creates a remote copy of a Git repo hosted on GitHub. This is particularly useful if you want to play around with a GitHub repo but you don't have write permissions to it; you can simply fork the repo and do whatever you want with the fork as you are the owner of the fork. Here are the steps:

**0. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one yet.**

**1. Go to the GitHub repo you want to fork** e.g., [samplerepo-things](https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-things)

**2. Click on the <img src="images/fork.png" height="30" /> button** on the top-right corner. In the next step, choose to fork to your own account or to another GitHub organization that you are an admin of.

{{ icon_info }} GitHub does not allow you to fork the same repo more than once to the same destination. If you want to re-fork, you need to delete the previous fork.
